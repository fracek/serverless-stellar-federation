Serverless Stellar Federation
=============================

This is a [Stellar Federation
Server](https://www.stellar.org/developers/guides/concepts/federation.html)
implemented as a Google Cloud Function.

The main advantage over the official federation server is that it's
serverless, so it will be cheaper to run for the average user.
